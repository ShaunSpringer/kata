What?
====
"Why do we write code? At one level, we’re trying to solve some particular problem, to add some kind of value to the world. But often there are also secondary objectives: the code has to solve the problem, and it also has to be fast, or easy to maintain, or extend, or whatever. So let’s look at that.

For this kata, we’re going to write a program to solve a simple problem, and we’re going to write it with three different sub-objectives. Our program is going do process the dictionary we used in previous kata, this time looking for all six letter words which are composed of two concatenated smaller words. For example:

  al + bums => albums
  bar + ely => barely
  be + foul => befoul
  con + vex => convex
  here + by => hereby
  jig + saw => jigsaw
  tail + or => tailor
  we + aver => weaver"
